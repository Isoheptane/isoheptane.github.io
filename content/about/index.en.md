My name is **Cascade Kobayashi**, and I'm a **Engineer Neko**. You can also call me **7C** or **C7**.

My name was **C7 Aerospace** and it's from a game *Kerbal Space Program*. In the game there is a company called C7 Aerospace Division. But I'm concerned about copyright, so I changed my nickname to **Isoheptane** (which, have 7 carbon atoms). But this nickname may not be a good name. So I decided to use **Cascade Kobayashi** as my former name.

I'm quite similar to my OC. Although articles in my blog may not reveal my feelings and emotions, but I'm quite casual in daily life to my friends. I may behave more formal to others, but I won't take it frivolously. So, don't be afraid of contacting me!
